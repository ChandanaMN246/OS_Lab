# OS_Lab

 This folder contains following problem codes:

1.Write a program to write a name into a file and read it back 

2.Use execvp command 

3.Use execvp commands to rename ‘ls’ command by your name 

4.Implement a hierarchy as shown below where third generation terminates first, followed by second, followed by first and then the parent 

5. program to create 2 dissimilar functions and create 4 threads , where each is operated alternately

6.Compare time taken to call function sequentially to calling in threads in above case  Hint: use clock() 

7.Increase to large number of threads (say 20) and again compare with sequential. Is the gain % same as #6? Make inferences.

8.Use Peterson’s solution to protect the critical section in the above code using the IP and Boolean flag. 

9.Implement a producer consumer chain using simple mechanisms for protecting the buffer 

10.Implement a producer consumer chain using simple mechanisms for protecting the buffer using linked list data structure. 

11.Implement a data structure to represent an adjacency matrix (e.g. 2d array). Take graph adjacency matrix as input with number of nodes and edges. 

12.Write an algorithm to detect cycle in the graph. A cycle in a directed graph is a non-empty trail where first and last nodes are equal. 

13.Write an algorithm for FCFS 

14.Write an algorithm for SJFS 

15.Page replacement algo

16.Binary tree
